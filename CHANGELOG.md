- **Improvement(example)**: Simplified main.dart and moved comprehensive example to scanner_page.dart with detailed documentation.
- **Enhancement(example)**: Added better UI organization, extensive code comments, and improved user experience with real-time scan data display.

## 0.0.7

- **Feature(example)**: Enhanced main.dart with comprehensive RoomPlanScanner example demonstrating proper initialization, real-time updates, and result handling.
- **Improvement(example)**: Added complete working code example that shows practical usage of all major features including error handling and resource disposal.

## 0.0.6

- **Feature**: Enhanced LiDAR detection with multi-method approach for better accuracy across different iOS devices and development environments.
- **Feature**: Added support for iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max models in LiDAR device detection.
- **Fix**: Added missing `CapturedRoom.Surface.Category` extension mapping for proper surface categorization (doors, windows, openings, walls).
- **Fix**: Corrected height mapping for doors and windows - now uses the correct Y component instead of Z component for opening height calculations.
- **Fix**: Resolved Swift compilation errors related to device identifier parsing using proper `String(cString:)` method.
- **Chore**: Removed debug logging from both native iOS and Flutter code for cleaner production builds.

## 0.0.5

- **Feature**: Added `floor` and `ceiling` properties to `RoomData` to provide direct access to these surfaces when available.
- **Feature**: Added `transform` (Matrix4) and `dimensions` (RoomDimensions) properties to `WallData`, `ObjectData`, and `OpeningData`. This provides more precise positioning and sizing data aligned with the latest native APIs.
